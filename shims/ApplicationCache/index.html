		<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/offline.html">
		(w3c) Application Cache</a> specifies a mechanism for selecting files to 
		store and load from the clients computer. Currently this is only supported by a handful of browsers and FF3.6 even broke their implementation so adoption has been thwarted.</p>
		<p>The shim <a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5-gears/">
		HTML5-gears by Brad Neuberg</a> attempts to 
		add support for this in IE browsers (although i have failed to get the shim working on IE 
		myself, perhaps my computer is special and you'll have better luck)</p>
